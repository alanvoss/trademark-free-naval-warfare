# Trademark-Free Naval Warfare!

## Overview

Trademark-free naval warfare is a game of strategy and luck. The game is played
on two 10x10 boards, with each player initializing their board before the game
begins. Initialization consists of placing the players 5 ships around their
board, and two ships cannot occupy the same square. The ships themselves are
classed as "Aircraft Carrier" (5x1), "Battleship" (4x1), "Cruiser" (3x1),
"Submarine" (3x1), and "Destroyer" (2x1). The gameboard axes are labeled 1-10 on
the vertical axis, and A-J on the horizontal axis.

Gameplay begins with player A selecting a coordinate on player B's board on
which to fire. Player B must inform player A whether their shot hit or missed
one of their ships. Then player B takes their turn selecting a coordinate and
firing. Gameplay continues like this until all the squares which a ship occupies
have been hit by enemy fire, at which point the player must announce the sinking
of the ship. The game is over once one of the players have lost all of their
ships.

Each player is allowed to keep track of their shots and the subsequent results,
and use this information when selecting where next to fire.
